 "abstract": "VSoil modeling platform is a tool designed to built models for the simulation of physical, chemical and biological processes occuring in a soil profile. It is based on the idea that modules simulating various phenomena can be reused and assembled to create models. The platform has four components. One named VSoil_Processes is designed to capitalize scientific knowledge on the processes. This tool helps defining processes or modifying existing ones. A second component, named VSoil_Modules is available to develop modules simulating a phenomena. This component helps modelers to develop and test their modules. It offers a text editor, easy access to the input and outputs variables of a module and a compiler for Fortran and C++. The developer can also test its module and display the results. The third tool, named VSoil_Models, is designed to help users assemble modules to create models. In particular, this tool guides the user when choosing the modules and checks that the modules are compatible with each other. When all the modules are chosen and have their inputs available, VSoil_Models compiles the model and creates a GUI. The model can be run and results displayed in graphical or textual form. The fourth component, name VSoil Player, is designed to run already available models, to compare models, to run a model on several data sets and to carry out sensitivity analysis. The platform can be freely downloaded. The platform is installed on users computers and run under Linux or Windows. Importation and exportation tools are availble to help users collaborate. This tools allows to easily exchange by mail : processes, modules and models.",
