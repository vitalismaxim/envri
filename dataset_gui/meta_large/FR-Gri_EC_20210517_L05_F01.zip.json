The site is a large cropland field (19 ha) located in the suburb of Paris and it is exposed to heavy atmospheric pollution coming from the Parisian area, the Benelux, as well as the south of England and Germany with east and northerly winds. On the contrary it is exposed to clean ocean air during south-westerly wind (which is the main wind direction).
